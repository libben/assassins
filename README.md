# libben.github.io
Assassins

Automated administrator for games of [Assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_\(game\)).

What you need:
1. Couchdb server with a database called "Assassins" to store your players in
2. RabbitMQ server
3. Node.js (installed globally)

Start both of those servers, change to your repository directory, then fire up your node server with
`$ DEBUG=libben.github.io:* npm start`

Known bugs:
app.locals is not recognized as a valid property in /routes/index.js, though
it is recognized just fine in /bin/www

Next big project: set up automated outbound email.

Note to self:
For goodness' sake, learn Git, Ben.
