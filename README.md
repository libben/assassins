# To-do
* Figure out how to make a text field to securely query data
(W3Schools says submit form data through POST)
(see https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Working_with_Forms)
* Figure out where I'll be installing CouchDB on the final site

Remember, Ben, this is how to commit:
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "(commit description)"
$ git push -u origin master
