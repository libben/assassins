# To-do
* Figure out how to make a text field securely query data
1. W3Schools says submit form data through POST
2. see https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Working_with_Forms
* Figure out where and how I'll be installing CouchDB on the final site, then set it up to work with Github Pages in the meantime

# Big Project Components
* Set up a mail server to send data through automated means to users
1. Enable GnuPG so people can receive their target keys encrypted
* Set up database of users
1. CouchDB is what I know and can work with, but I hear good things about MongoDB
2. Make several views for querying in different contexts with JavaScript
* Write functions in JavaScript for various types of database interaction
1. Reading from the database based on a key
2. Writing changes to the database
* Make it look pretty

Remember, Ben, this is how to commit:
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "(commit description)"
$ git push -u origin master
